Searching for gold in the sand,
Wandering shieldless in no man's land.
Giving you all that I can,
You take my love then make me feel so damned.

Now I'm delirious, you don't take this serious,
Don't you patronise me baby.
You keep mysterious, or am I just oblivious?
Do your plan to drive me crazy.

You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.
You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.

Watching the night turn to day
Thinking of wasting my life away.
Keeping the doubters at bay,
Waiting for those words I wish you'd say.

Locked in a fantasy, or is this insanity,
You know how to test my patence.
But there's no gravity, working your anatomy,
Giving me these sweet sensations.

You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.
You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.

Keep on coming back for more,
Got me knocking down your door,
You know how to take me higher
You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.

You got me feeling like
Something just ain't right.
Why did I let you in
And let this all begin?
I wish I could forget
The day that we first met
And now it's blowing up,
Still I can't get enough
Oh oh yeah baby

Do you know?
Do you know what you're doing?
What you're doing?
Oh baby, let me go

You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.
You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it

Keep on coming back for more,
Got me knocking down your door,
You know how to take me higher.
You got me feeling for your power,
Turn the music louder, let me feel it.
