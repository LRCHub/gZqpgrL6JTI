[00:07.45] This style seems wild, wait before you treat me like a stepchild
[00:17.66] Let me tell you why they got me on file
[00:19.01] 'Cause I give you what you lack, come right and exact
[00:20.58] Our status is the saddest so I care where you at, black
[00:48.08] 
[00:22.37] And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
[00:24.29] The FBI was tappin' my telephone
[00:25.91] I never live alone, I never walk alone
[00:28.30] My posses always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone
[00:55.30] 
[00:29.72] Although I live the life that of a resident
[00:32.10] But I be known to scheme that of the president
[00:33.56] Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
[00:35.52] I stand accused of doin' harm
[00:50.02] 
[00:36.93] 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[00:38.26] Come on
[00:40.40] I'm louder than a bomb
[00:41.81] Come on
[00:45.31] 
[00:43.84] I am the rock hard trooper to the bone the bone the bone
[00:54.10] Full grown consider me stone
[00:56.04] Once again and I say it for you to know
[00:58.32] The troop is always ready, I yell Geronimo
[01:19.32] 
[01:00.07] Your CIA, you see I ain't kiddin'
[01:01.81] Both King and X they got ridda' both
[01:03.43] A story untold, true, but unknown
[01:05.22] Professor Griff knows I ain't milquetoast
[01:25.72] 
[01:07.24] Of those with closed minds, don't know I'm rapid
[01:09.21] The way that I rap it is making 'em tappin', yeah
[01:11.25] Never serving â€~em well, 'cause I'm an Un-Tom
[01:13.38] It's no secret at all
[01:23.88] 
[01:14.50] 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[01:15.78] Come on
[01:18.08] I'm louder than a bomb
[01:19.96] Come on
[01:23.46] 
[01:21.84] Cold holdin' the load, the burden breakin' the mold
[01:31.99] I ain't lyin' denyin' because they're checkin' my code
[01:33.64] Am I buggin' 'cause they're buggin' my phone for information
[01:35.61] No tellin' who's sellin' out buildin' the nation
[01:59.61] 
[01:37.49] Joinin' the set, the point black target
[01:39.45] Every brother's inside so least not, you forgot, no
[01:41.22] Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste
[01:43.02] A bit of the song so you can never be wrong
[02:04.52] 
[01:44.74] Just a bit of advice, â€~cause we be payin' the price
[01:46.78] 'Cause every brother man's life is like swingin' the dice, right?
[01:48.94] Here it is, once again this is the brother to brother
[01:51.58] The Terminator the cutter
[02:04.08] 
[01:52.84] Going on and on, leave alone the grown
[01:54.24] Get is straight in '88, an' I'll troop in to demonstrate
[01:56.19] The posse always ready 98 at 98
[01:58.19] My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity
[02:23.19] 
[01:59.85] Tapping' my phone, they never leave me alone
[02:01.74] I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed
[02:17.74] 
[02:03.31] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[02:05.43] Come on
[02:06.56] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[02:08.55] Come on
[02:12.05] 
[02:10.35] â€~Cause the D is for dangerous, you can come and get some of this
[02:28.30] I teach and speak so when it's spoke, it's no joke
[02:30.16] The voice of choice the place shakes with bass
[02:31.90] Called one for the treble, the rhythm is a rebel
[02:55.90] 
[02:33.69] Here's a funky rhyme that they're tappin' on
[02:35.46] Just thinkin' I'm breakin' the beats that I'm rappin'on
[02:37.29] CIA, FBI, all they tell us is lies
[02:39.07] And when I say it they get alarmed
[02:56.07] 
[02:40.72] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[02:43.02] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[02:58.52] 
[02:49.57] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[02:56.76] Come on
[03:00.26] 
[02:59.04] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
[03:04.46] â€~Cause I'm louder than a bomb
