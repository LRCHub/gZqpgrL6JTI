The need to turn it up is overwhelming
I just can't sit still anymore
I wanna break things with my hammer
I wanna start a little war

Isn't that what this little red button here is for?
[(Ooh)] I wish this song was louder
[(Ooh)] I wish this song was louder

Evil policeman patrol the city
They look for somebody to kill
They've done a little damage, they wanna do some more now
And they probably will
And they probably will

[(Ooh)] I wish this song was louder
[(Ooh)] I wish this song was louder

One night I had a vision that the world was taken over
By a race of dirty filthy birds
I dropped to my knees and I begged for mercy
But they never understand a word
No, I was never heard

Hey now cheeky monkey
[(Ooh)] Take a ride on the dirty donkey
[(Ooh)] I wish this song was louder
[(Ooh)] I wish this song was louder
[(Ooh)]
